# 🛬 Yield Aggregation

Caddy Finance's yield aggregation is a key feature that combines yields from various sources into a single, maxmizied pool. Let's break down how it works:

### 🌈 Diverse Yield Sources

At the top of the yield aggregation process, we see various financial instruments:

* 🏢 REITs on Polygon: Real Estate Investment Trusts tokenized on the Polygon blockchain
* ☀️ Solar projects on XDC: Yields from solar energy investments on the XDC network
* 📜 T-Bills on Cosmos: Treasury Bills tokenized on the Cosmos blockchain
* 💳 Credit products on Celo: Credit-based yields on the Celo platform
* ... : Additional yield sources that may be added over time

Each of these represents a different type of yield opportunity in the blockchain space.

### 🟩 The Yield Aggregation Process

In the middle of the image, we see a green bar labeled "Yield Aggregation". This represents Caddy's core aggregation technology:

* Collects yields from multiple blockchain platforms
* Combines different yield types into a single pool
* Optimizes the yield distribution for maximum efficiency

### 🎯 Caddy Finance Platform

At the bottom, the Caddy Finance logo represents the final destination for the aggregated yields:

* Receives the combined yields from various sources
* Distributes the maxmizied yields to users
* Manages the overall yield strategy

### How It Works

1. Yield sources from different blockchains generate returns
2. Caddy's aggregation technology collects these yields
3. The yields are combined and maxmizied
4. Caddy Finance distributes the aggregated yields to users
