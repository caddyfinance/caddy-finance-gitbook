# 🧁 RWA Yields vs Digital Asset Yields

### RWA Yields 🏛️

Real World Asset yields are derived from tangible, physical assets.

#### Characteristics:

* Stable and predictable returns
* Backed by real-world value
* Generally lower risk profile

#### Advantages:

* Consistent income streams
* Value floor due to underlying assets
* Lower volatility

#### Disadvantages:

* Typically lower yields
* Less liquidity
* Slower to adapt to market changes

### Digital Asset Yields 🚀

Digital Asset yields come from various cryptocurrency and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) mechanisms.

#### Characteristics:

* Highly variable returns
* Based on digital scarcity and network effects
* Generally higher risk profile

#### Advantages:

* Potential for high yields
* Greater liquidity
* Innovative yield-generating strategies

#### Disadvantages:

* Higher volatility
* Increased risk of total loss
* Regulatory uncertainty

### Comparison Example 📊

To illustrate the difference, let's consider a hypothetical investment of $10,000:

1. RWA Yield (e.g., Real Estate Investment Trust):
   * Annual yield: 5-7%
   * Potential return after 1 year: $10,500 - $10,700
   * Risk: Low to moderate
2. Digital Asset Yield (e.g., Liquidity Provision in DeFi):
   * Annual yield: 20-200% (highly variable)
   * Potential return after 1 year: $12,000 - $30,000
   * Risk: High to very high
