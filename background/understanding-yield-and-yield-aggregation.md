# 💰 Understanding Yield and Yield Aggregation&#x20;

### 💸 What is Yield?

Yield is like the magic money-making machine of investments! It's the income your investment generates over time, usually shown as a percentage. In the financial world, yield can come from various exciting sources:

1. 💼 **Dividends**: Companies sharing their profits with shareholders. Cha-ching!
2. 🏦 **Interest**: The reward for lending your money to others. Ka-ching!
3. 🏠 **Rent**: Money rolling in from your real estate empire. Ker-ching!
4. 📈 **Capital Gains**: Selling something for more than you bought it. Boom-ching!

In the wild world of decentralized finance (DeFi), yield often comes from:

1. 🏦 **Lending**: Earning interest by being a crypto bank. Money printer go brrr!
2. 🌊 **Liquidity Provision**: Getting rewarded for keeping the crypto markets flowing. Splash the cash!
3. 🥩 **Staking**: Earning returns for helping keep the network secure. Stake it 'til you make it!
